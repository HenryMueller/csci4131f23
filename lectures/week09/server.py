    method will be the HTTP method used, for our server that's GET, POST, DELETE
    url is the partial url, just like seen in previous assignments

         or the body will be a string-parsed version of what data was sent.
    headers will be a python dictionary containing all sent headers.

    This function returns 3 things:
    The response body (a string containing text, or binary data)
    The response code (200 = ok, 404=not found, etc.)
    A _dictionary_ of headers. This should always contain Content-Type as seen in the example below.
